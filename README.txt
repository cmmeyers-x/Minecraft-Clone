Midterm Project - The main Atraction 

Description: 
	Program runs a world with the three characters. Lights are showcased using the Phong Reflectance model with Gourad shading.
   	Types of lights are also shown including directional, point source and flashlight. Different cameras can be controlled
   	including arcBall freecam and first person.


Usage: 
	1 - switch to free cam 
	2 - switch to arcball (must have character selected)
	3 - turn on first person (only avaliable when arcball selected)


	4 - switch to player 1 
	5 - switch to player 2
	6 - switch to player 3


Issues:
	We had problems getting the directional light to work. 
	We got it to display, but never could get the math correct. 
	

Responsibilities: 
	Everything was pair programmed, and we all worked together on discord
	to complete the project. 


Length:
	20 hours

The labs didn't really help with the directional lighting. This stuff is really
hard and I wished we had more direction :/ 2
